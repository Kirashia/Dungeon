09/01/2018, 14:16 - 	Added entrances and exits to walkable space
			Fixed solution path
			Added multiple enemies and enemy prefab

02/01/2018, 14:04 - 	entrances and exits instantiated although in the incorrect positions
			world translated into 3d environment, player and walls now 3d

15/12/2017, 00:09 - 	map generation completed, barre start and end tiles, and item placement
			minor error (leave for now) where exits between rooms leave a small line in the walls

14/12/2017, 17:09 -	fixed marching sq errors
			added map border
			started work on corridors (research)

14/12/2017, 16:34 - 	noticed each room has a 1x1 border of wall0 on right and bottom edges, no wall15 there either, working on fix
			renamed rooms to be the direction in the solution path
			renamed tiles to be their coordinates
			(16:48) error found to be in "GetScoreFor" in the marching sqaures portion of the code. disregarded the boundary values of x and y hence creating accidental border [FIXED]

14/12/2017, 16:05 - 	cleaned code to remove warnings in the editor
			removed unused functions

14/12/2017, 15:41 - 	fixed map generation so that rooms now create cellular automata caverns
			rooms created in a 4x4 grid rather than added to eachother's end
			solution path maze works 90% of the time, needs checking
